<h1> Hi there 👋 <h1/> <h3>  
I worked to create the SoW addon, and I kinda develop that sometimes. I'm working on my old SoW Minecraft Sever, it's got a nice discord as well. I'm writing a book, you might hear a bit more about that later. Hope you have a great time. God bless! 

🔭 I’m currently working on a bunch of stuff, you can check my repository to find out

🌱 I’m currently learning javascript and development
